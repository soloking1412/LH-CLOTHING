## Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Configuration
The Firebase configuration is already set up in `src/firebase/config.js` with your project details:
- Project ID: `cafe-billing-96901`
- Authentication enabled for email/password
- Realtime Database configured

### 2. Database Security Rules
**IMPORTANT**: Update your Firebase Realtime Database security rules to allow authenticated users to read/write their data:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "$uid === auth.uid",
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Dependencies
Ensure these packages are installed:
```bash
npm install firebase react-router-dom react-icons
```

## Usage

### User Registration
1. Click the login button in the header
2. Switch to "Sign Up" mode
3. Fill in required information (first name, last name, email, phone, password)
4. Submit to create account

### User Login
1. Click the login button in the header
2. Enter email and password

## Future Enhancements

### Payment Integration

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Firebase Authentication for secure user management
- User data isolation (users can only access their own data)
- Secure password handling through Firebase
- Session management with automatic logout

### Recommended Enhancements
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Add rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Add audit logging for security events
- Regular security updates and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication Errors**: Check Firebase configuration and internet connection
2. **Database Access Denied**: Verify security rules are properly configured
3. **Profile Not Loading**: Ensure user is authenticated and profile exists
4. **Order Creation Failed**: Check database permissions and user authentication

### Debug Mode
Enable console logging for debugging:
```javascript
// In AuthContext.js, add console.log statements for debugging
console.log('Auth state changed:', user);
console.log('User profile:', userProfile);
```

## Support

For technical support or questions about the authentication system:
1. Check Firebase console for errors
2. Verify database security rules
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

**Note**: This authentication system is designed for customer use only. Admin functionality is not included as per requirements. The system is ready for production use once Stripe payment integration is implemented.
